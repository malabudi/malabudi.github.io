                <p>
                    I'm a self-motivated software developer based in Dearborn, Michigan, currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Software Engineering (expected graduation: 
                    December 2024). My primary expertise lies in full-stack web development, supplemented by ongoing learning in AWS cloud technologies. I'm keen to 
                    master industry-standard frameworks, explore mobile development, and deepen my cloud expertise. Additionally, I've completed two software engineering 
                    internships and undertaken various personal projects.
                <br /><br />
                    Beyond software development, I am an active member in the goodle developer society club (GDSC) at University of Michigan - Dearborn.
                    I've also participated in hackathons, one during rocket company's hackweek during my internship in Summer 2023, and HackDearborn
                    hosted by GDSC in Fall 2023. I also enjoy gaming, cooking, and play guitar and drums.
